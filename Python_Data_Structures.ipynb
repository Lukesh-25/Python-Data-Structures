They define the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs.\n",

For example, arrays are suitable for storing elements in a fixed order, while linked lists are useful when frequent insertions and deletions are required. Hash tables provide fast access to data using keys, and trees or graphs are ideal for representing hierarchical or networked data.\n",

        "\n",

        "# Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable:\n",
        "1. Efficiency:\n",
        "Immutability allows Python to optimize the use of memory. Since strings cannot be modified, Python can reuse the memory allocated for a string. Instead of creating new copies of the string every time a modification is made, Python can simply reference the existing string. This helps in reducing memory consumption and improving performance, especially when handling large numbers of strings.\n",

        "Immutability ensures that strings cannot be accidentally changed, which helps preserve the integrity of data.

        "\n",
        "3. Hashing and Usage as Dictionary Keys:\n",
        "Immutability makes strings hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries.

If strings were mutable, their hash value could change, leading to unpredictable behavior in data structures like dictionaries.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Implementation of String Concatenation:\n",
        "Python handles string concatenation by creating new strings every time two or more strings are combined. Since strings are immutable, this ensures that the original strings are not changed and that the new string is a separate object. This design choice simplifies memory management and avoids issues related to modifying strings while they are being used in other parts of the program.\n",
